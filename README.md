# Movie Trailer Website
This is a website that will allow you to see images of all of your favourite movies, whilst also allowing you to view their trailers after clicking on their poster image.

## Instructions
* First Download the zip file containing the website and python files.
* After installing the project files open the python file `entertainment_center.py`
* Save and run this file using a python interpreter to create the webpage.
* Open your website and watch all your favourite movies come to life.
## Want More Movies?!
To add more movies to your website you will need to edit the main python file `entertainment_center.py`. 
You will need to collect store some information about the movie you want to add such ass:
* Movie title
* Movie storyline
* Poster image url 
* Youtube trailer url
for example this is how I added deadpool to my website
```
deadpool = media.Movie("Deadpool",
                       "A film about an anti-hero",
                       "http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTvrIHJfa\
                       sS6poy34esN1O5hZonXaiqfEZb4WbnbAa9qJCIL8_9",
                       "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONHBaC-pfsk")
```
After this just save a rerun the programme and enjoy.# movie-website
